# Developers' Notes

We welcome contributions from you!

If you find a feature in Google Scholar missing in `scholarly`, or find a bug, please feel free to open an appropriate issue based on the two templates you will find.
Additionally, if you are interesting in contributing to the codebase, submit a pull request *after* you open an issue.

## What to contribute

1. If you are new to open-source projects, go through the Issues page and pick one that interests you. The ones with the label "good first issue" are usually simple enough and are new-contributor friendly.
2. If you use `scholarly` in your projects and encounter a bug or need a feature, create an issue first before working on a solution. The issue page can be used for decision-making and design-choices and is meant to utilize your efforts better.

## How to contribute

1. Create a fork of `scholarly-python-package/scholarly` repository.
2. If you add a new feature, try to include tests in already existing test cases, or create a new test case if that is not possible.
3. Make sure the unit tests pass before raising a PR. For all the unit tests to pass, you typically need to setup a premium proxy service such as `ScraperAPI` or `Luminati` (`Bright Data`). If you do not have an account, you may try to use `FreeProxy`. Without a proxy, 6 out of 17 test cases will be skipped.
4. Check that the documentatation is consistent with the code. Check that the documentation builds successfully.
5. Submit a PR, with `develop` as your base branch.
6. After an initial code review by the maintainers, the unit tests will be run with the `ScraperAPI` key stored in the Github repository. Passing all tests cases is necessary before merging your PR.


## Build Docs

To build the documentation execute the make file as:

```bash
cd docs
make html
```
